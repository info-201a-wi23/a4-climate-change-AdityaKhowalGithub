I have chosen to analyze A countries GDP and Consumption per GDP

Then, in at least 200 words, describe the dataset that you're analyzing, and be sure to answer the following questions: Who collected the data? How was the data collected or generated? Why was the data collected? What are possible limitations or problems with this data?Â 

Then, you will share at least **5 relevant values** of interest. These will likely be calculated using your DPLYR skills, answering questions such as*:*

-   *What is the average value of my variable across all the countries?*

-   *Where is my variable the highest / lowest?*

-   *How much has my variable change over the last N years?*

# Closing Thoughts

Overall it seems as our CO2 emmissions have only worsened over time, so much so that the scales on my graph have to change to adapt the new values. The max value shown on my maps legend in 1990 is 5000, while in 2020 it is over 10,000. It is crazy to see that max emissions from just one country has more than doubled in 30 years. The average CO2 has also almost doubled in this period of time. It is also noticeable that the USA and China seem to dominate in terms of emissions, and as two major world powers I think that there should be responsibility on them to improve this situation before it becomes more dire.
